# actix-rust-OAuth

Rust has picked up a lot of momentum since we last looked at it in 2015. Companies like Amazon and Microsoft have adopted it for a growing number of use cases. Microsoft, for example, sponsors the Actix project on GitHub, which is a general purpose open source actor framework based on Rust. The Actix project also maintains a RESTful API development framework, which is widely regarded as a fast and performant web framework. Although the project was temporarily on hold in early 2020, the project ownership has moved to a new maintainer, and development continues.

I was about to start a new project on Cardano blockchain and we need simple CRUD operations with Database of users and products and create a portal to communicate with Cardano blockchain.
This repo is only for creating CRUD operations with basic OAuth. A little showcase how `Rust` works on `actix-web` framework.

## RESTful API CRUD Operations
* GET /users
* GET /users/{id}
* POST /users
* DELETE /users/{id}
